# tf_custom_attributes
A set of custom attributes which uses rafradek's Hidden Dev Attributes plugin to inject the attributes directly into the item schema. What this essentially means is that these attributes can be used on any weapons, custom or official.

# Installing

rafradek's Hidden dev attributes plugin is necessary for this plugin to run. It can be downloaded here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=326853

Both the plugins and the zethaxattribs.txt files are required for these attributes to work. One will not work without the other sort of thing.

These plugins are rather dirty, and I'm absolutely certain there are better ways they could work. However, because I'm not a professional, I haven't figured out a way to make them better and more lightweight. The attributes themselves guaranteed work, but not without some system overhead for sure. Just be aware of this if your server is running a lot of other plugins already.

# Source Code

Sources are provided if you want to see my god awful self-taught coding techniques. Also suggestions for better ways to make certain attributes work would be absolutely welcome. Always happy to learn from those that are better than me.
